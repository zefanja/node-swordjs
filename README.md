node-swordJS
============

There is currently no way to access the bible modules of the SWORD Project (http://crosswire.org/sword) with Javascript. Node-swordJS wants to fill this gap. It is based on the sources of the [cross-connect app](code.google.com/p/cross-connect/).

Before you can use this node module, you need to install `async`.

```
npm install async
```

See `app.js` for how to use this module.
